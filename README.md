# TIC TAC TOE

Tic-tac-toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. Here I made the same  game with some inbuilt features. The device guides you on your turn and also declares the winner when any of the player wins. It also includes a reset button which starts the game from beginning.
